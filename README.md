# Web Payload Dropper

Web Payload Dropper  (WPD for short) is a tool built on top of the PHP framework with the idea of making managing web payloads easier and faster.

# How Do I Use It?

It is quite simple. You just copy the files onto your web server and visit the /panel/ directory.
You can also use the git command to do this:

> cd /var/www/html 

> git clone https://github.com/ChrisDoesEverything/WPD.git

# How Does It Work?

The `/panel/` folder is the place whenre you will be doing all of the work, in it you can manage the payload and copy the dropper code.

You place the dropper code onto any website and it will execute the payload you wrote on the `/panel/` page.

You can change the payload on the `/panel/` page and it will update all the payload on the website you placed it on, instantly.
